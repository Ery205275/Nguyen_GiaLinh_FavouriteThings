# Nguyen_G_Favourite_Things
A mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. Includings at least 4 properties (name, description, images, etc). The three “things” should be represented by an interactive control on the page(button, image, etc) - when the user engages with the control, show more data about that“thing”.

## Intsallation (Tools)
HTML & CSS
Javascript
Visual Studio Code

##Plan/Path
1. Create data.json file inlcudes all the require data.
2. Create index.html to structure the layout of the page and containers to show data.
3. Create functions in main.js to fetch data and show data.
4. Create buttons element to show each data set seperately when get clicked.
5. Create buttons' show function to show data set when click buttons.
6. After all datas and functions work, style each section/component of the page separately using sass.
7. Adding a close button to close opened tab (src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19127840/adding-close-button-to-auto-pop-up-window). Close function works but has to restart page to see data again. Will work more on this.
8. Push everything to Github and merge to main branch when finished
